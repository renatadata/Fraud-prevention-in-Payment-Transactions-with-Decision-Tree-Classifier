# Fraud-prevention-in-Payment-Transactions-with-Decision-Tree-Classifier
Payment fraud management is critical to prevent losses, protect the organization, and ensure operations are smooth, secure and scalable. Considering the ever-changing nature of fraud technology and techniques and the sophistication of e-commerce solutions, solutions are needed to properly handle payment fraud. In this example we will create a Predictive Machine to Detect Transactions that are possibly fraudulent based on data from the Payment Gateway service of a large Brazilian Startup. Here we will use Decision trees which are classification methods that are able to extract simple rules about the characteristics of the data that are inferred from the input. data set. Several algorithms for inducing decision trees are available in the literature. We'll start with importing the libraries and data.
